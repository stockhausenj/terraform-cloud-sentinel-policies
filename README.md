# terraform-cloud-sentinel-policies

Sentinel policy code for pasting into Terraform Cloud under the Free plan. If using an upgraded Plan you can integrate with a version control system (VCS). Read more [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/sentinel/vcs).

## Notes
The GitHub [hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies/tree/main) repository says that the contents of the repository are being migrated to the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/policies). But as of writing this there are only a few AWS (and likely other cloud providers) policies in the registry.
